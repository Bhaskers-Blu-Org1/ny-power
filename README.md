We recently bought a Chevy Bolt EV, which we use as our primary
vehicle. We charge at home with a Level 2 charger. When should we
charge the car?

Static time of use billing in our area marks peak at 2pm - 7pm
weekdays. While that's the only time the power company doesn't want
you to charge, the grid varies a lot over the course of the day.
